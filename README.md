1. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/agorf/thyme`
1. Enter checked out directory: `cd thyme`
1. Install Ruby gems: `bundle install`
   * You need to have [bundler][] installed for this

## Use

1. Scan photos: `go run ./script/scan_photos.go /path/to/photos
   /another/path/to/photos`
   * You need to have [Go][] installed for this
   * You can build a `./scan_photos` binary to avoid compiling each time:
     `go build ./script/scan_photos.go`
   * It took 5m29s to scan 17407 photos on my system (~53 photos/sec)
1. Generate thumbs: `go run ./script/generate_thumbs.go`
   * You need to have [Go][] installed for this
   * You can build a `./generate_thumbs` binary to avoid compiling each time:
     `go build ./script/generate_thumbs.go`
   * It may take a while the first time
1. Run app with `./script/server` and point your browser to
   <http://localhost:9292/>

Run `go run ./script/scan_photos.go` (or `./scan_photos` if you've built a
binary) and `go run ./script/generate_thumbs.go` (or `./generate_thumbs` if
you've built a binary) to add new photos.

```javascript
mapbox_map_id = "your_map_id_here"
mapbox_api_token = "your_api_token_here"
```
